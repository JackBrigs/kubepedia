# argo-cd 0.7: defects fixed in the 0.7 line

## Summary

**8 defects** the project fixed across **2 releases** of the 0.7 line, from 0.7.0 to
0.7.1. A cluster running a version below the one an entry sits under still carries that defect.

Use this before reproducing a suspected bug: on this line it is often already named and fixed, and
the remedy is a patch bump rather than an investigation.

## Problem

Entries are grouped by the release that fixed them, oldest first.

## Context

### 0.7.0

- Fix saving default connection status for repos and clusters
- Fix undesired fail-fast behavior of health check
- Fix memory leak in the cluster resource watch

### 0.7.1

- Expand RBAC role to be able to create application events. Fix username claims extraction
- Fix scalability issues with the ListApps API (#494)
- Fix issue where application server was retrieving events from incorrect cluster (#478)
- Fix failure in identifying app source type when path was '.'
- Fix linux download link in getting_started.md (#487) (@chocopowwwa)


## Diagnostics

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide      # node-level components
helm list -A                   # chart-deployed components
```

Compare the running version against **0.7.1**, the newest release recorded here for this line.

## Known Issues

The list is machine-extracted from upstream release notes: lines shorter than 45 characters and
duplicates are dropped, since headings and list fragments reach the extractor looking like entries.
Treat it as an index into upstream notes, not as a substitute for them — a defect that matters gets
its own analysed document with sources, diagnostics and a remedy.

Behaviour changes for the same component are tracked separately, in its breaking-changes document:
they are not defects and do not disappear with an upgrade.
